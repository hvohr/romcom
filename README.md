# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

- We built an interactive website that allows a user to make their own books, with the option to recieve a randomized book cover, title, and taglines. The user can also input their own cover, title and taglines while also having the ability to save this customized cover and view it. The user can also save and view any randomized covers they make as well. The user also has the ability to delete any saved cover they do not want anymore. The user can also successfully navigate through the website with buttons that take them to different pages of the site.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

- The user must have access to a github and navigate to my github account hvohr/romcom. In order to clone the romcom repository, the user must click the green *code* button and copy the SSH key that is located there. The user then should navigate to terminal. The user should then type in the phrase git clone and then paste the copied SSH key. Using `ls` in the terminal, the user can see if this was successfully cloned. The user should move into the romcom directory and then type in `open index.html`. This will allow them to now see the functioning website.
