# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

- We built an interactive website that allows a user to make their own books, with the option to recieve a randomized book cover, title, and taglines. The user can also input their own cover, title and taglines while also having the ability to save this customized cover and view it. The user can also save and view any randomized covers they make as well. The user also has the ability to delete any saved cover they do not want anymore. The user can also successfully navigate through the website with buttons that take them to different pages of the site. The original problem of the website was that the buttons were non-functional and we had the task of making them functional again along with the website as a whole. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

- The user must have access to a github and navigate to my github account hvohr/romcom. In order to clone the romcom repository, the user must click the green *code* button and copy the SSH key that is located there. The user then should navigate to terminal. The user should then type in the phrase git clone and then paste the copied SSH key. Using `ls` in the terminal, the user can see if this was successfully cloned. The user should move into the romcom directory and then type in `open index.html`. This will allow them to now see the functioning website. 


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)



### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

- We are Mod1 students and we spent a total of 3 days on this project. On average, we spent around 6 hours a day working together in a driver/navigator setting. We swapped back and forth with driving and navigating and supported eachother when a person did not understand a concept or a piece of code. 

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- The learning goals of this project were to write clean and DRY javascript while also succeeding in a collaborative environment with another induvidual. The goal was to create a interactive website that runs smoothly and followed the rubric guidelines. We worked with HTML data and CSS data files to successfully write javascript code that forged a connection between the languages. We used Turing resources along with MDN Docs and Stack Overflow as online sources. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

- We feel as though successfully completing the project counts as a massive win. Another win was being able to understand and utilize the concepts we learned in class and on our own in a real life setting. We worked more with our git workflow skills and the ability to work in a collaborative manner. A challenge we faced was navigating Github and naming conventions for a smoother git workflow. Another challenge we faced was learning how to take small steps and go through the process of figuring something out without taking huge unnessecary leaps. Breaking it down collaboratively would been really beneficial in early iterations but by iteration 4, we had a much more successful time figuring out how to psuedocode and take our time.
